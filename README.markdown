![Meet Chuck.](https://github.com/msanders/Chuck/raw/master/readme-images/stache.png)

Chuck is the simple, efficient app launcher with class.

Chuck is designed to be quick and simple, and to get out of your way -- just type in the first few letters of your applications and you're finished; or, better yet, set up a few aliases so that switching between and launching your favorite apps will become single-character muscle memory you don't know how you lived without. Best of all, it has a very low footprint and is instantaneous in all that it does. (Plus, who wouldn't want a moustache in their menu bar?)
