Chuck is a simple, efficient app launcher with class. Unlike some other apps of its genre, Chuck is designed to be quick and simple, and to get out of your way -- just type in the first few letters of your applications and you're finished; there is nothing new to learn, and little to configure. Best of all, it has a low footprint and is essentially instantanous in all that it does. After a few minutes of use, you will forget it is there and so will your machine. (And, who wouldn't want a moustache in their menu bar?)

Currently available for OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and above.
